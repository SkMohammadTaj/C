                The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) was founded in 2008, providing an
                undergraduate program in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Initially, the program had an intake
                of 60 students, which steadily rose to 198 by 2023. In pursuit of its mission and vision, the department
                boasts ample infrastructure, including well-equipped laboratories and licensed software such as Xilinx,
                Code Composer Studio, MATLAB, LABTEK, Microwind, NS-2 to develop intelligent systems and MASM, ensuring
                comprehensive support for academic endeavors.

                The Department is committed to providing students with access to cutting-edge technologies through
                various avenues such as NPTEL online resources, webinars conducted by Texas Instruments, spoken
                tutorials, SWAYAM, and FOSSEE by IIT Bombay. Additionally, students benefit from hands-on experience
                with LabVIEW through collaboration with National Instruments (NI), as well as workshops and internships
                organized in partnership with the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC).
